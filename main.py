import pygame


# The idea is to create a town for every user in a country where users from the same region play toguether, 
# the town can have farms for recources, houses for workers and schools and millitary for defence/attaques. 
# I have 16 days until the deadline, if I manage one big task per day I can make it, I never used pygames before, I work with more visual IDE like unreal, I need the money so, just deal with it.
# Steps: 
# 1 pygame docs and setup + init code 
# 2 database connection and user registration and town init 
# 3 a grid system to manage spots in the town and spawn new buildings 
# 4 input controller and setup clicks events
# 5 will see from there
